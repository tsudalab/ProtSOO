KNOWN BUGS of ProtPOS-1.1

The following will be fixed and released in the next version (minor)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG-001

PROBLEM: When the current directory has no ProtPOS prediction and calling
clustering analysis, it gives errors:

SUGGESTION: should not run the clustering analysis script but tell the user 
there is no prediction found in current directory

SNAPSHOT: 
Installation checking passed.
mv: cannot stat `debug.log': No such file or directory
mv: cannot stat `residues_energy.txt': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access cluster/cluster*.pdf: No such file or directory
0 cluster(s) were found.
For more details, please look at cluster directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG-002 

PROBLEM: After a run is complete, no way to tell in the log or somewhere 
what were the ProtPOS run parameters used.  This is a desired feature 
rather than a problem.

SUGGESTION: Save somewhere what are the parameters of this run
